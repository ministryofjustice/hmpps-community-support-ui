## Instructions

## Running the app via docker-compose

The easiest way to run the app is to use docker compose to create the service and all dependencies.

`docker compose pull`

`docker compose up`

### Running the app for development

To start the main services excluding the example typescript template app:

`docker compose up --scale=app=0`

Create an environment file by copying `.env.example` -> `.env`
Environment variables set in here will be available when running `start:dev`

Install dependencies using `npm install`, ensuring you are using `node v24`

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder
to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json`
and the github pipeline build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with esbuild:

`npm run start:dev`

### Logging in with a test user

Once the application is running you should then be able to login with:

username: AUTH_USER
password: password123456

### Run linter

- `npm run lint` runs `eslint`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs the TypeScript compiler `tsc`.

### Run unit tests

`npm run test`

### Running integration tests

For local running, start a wiremock instance by:

`docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with auto-restart on changes)

After first install ensure playwright is initialised:

`npm run int-test-init`

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`

Or run tests with the UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

### Slack channel for pipeline security notifications

Ths channel should be specific to your team and is for daily / weekly security scanning job results. It is your team's
responsibility to keep up-to-date with security issues and update your application so that these jobs pass. You will
only be notified if the jobs fail. The scan results can always be found in GitHub actions and results are sent to the GitHub security tab. This is
configured by setting GitHub actions environment variable called `SECURITY_ALERTS_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`.

## Change log

A changelog for the service is available [in this document.](./CHANGELOG.md)
